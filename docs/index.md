K8s snap documentation
======================

The K8s snap is a performant, lightweight, secure and opinionated distribution 
of Kubernetes which includes all the components needed to create and manage
a scaleable cluster suitable for all use cases.



**Snaps** are Linux app packages for **desktop**, **cloud** and **IoT** that are self-contained, simple to install,
secure, cross-platform, and dependency-free.

They **update automatically** and typically run within a **confined** and **transaction-based** environment. **Security and robustness** are their key features, alongside being **easy to install**, **easy to maintain** and **easy to upgrade**.

Snaps help **desktop** users effortlessly install and run apps like [Spotify](https://snapcraft.io/spotify) or [Slack](https://snapcraft.io/slack). They help **sysadmins** run servers like [NextCloud](<https://snapcraft.io/nextcloud>), **developers** to package and distribute their work to the global [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store), and they help everyone build and deploy **IoT** devices running [Ubuntu Core](https://ubuntu.com/core).

From Linux and maker space tinkerers, to the robotics, automotive and signage industries; from your desktop to a deployment of thousands, snap can handle it.
